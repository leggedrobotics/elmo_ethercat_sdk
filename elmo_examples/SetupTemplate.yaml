# This is a robot setup file for EtherCAT                                     #
###############################################################################

# The elmo::ethercat::ElmoEthercatMaster class needs some information about your
# ELMO drive setup. To provide this information:
# 1. Create a yaml file like this and load it using loadSetup(..).
# All information within the file or the struct is optional.
# If you do not provide it, the default values are chosen.

# This file contains information about the setup of an ELMO drive robot, such as
# the amount of ELMO drives and where they are connected.

# Each parameter is documented with name, description, type, unit, range and
# default value.

# Parameter                 ELMO drives
# Description               A list of your ELMO drives.
# Type                      List
# Unit                      -
# Range                     -
# Default                   Single ELMO drive with default setup.
elmodrives:

  # Parameter               name
  # Description             Unique name of the ELMO slave drive.
  #                         Can be chosen arbitrarily (as long as it is unique).
  # Type                    string
  # Unit                    -
  # Range                   -
  # Default                 "elmodrive"
- name:                     "elmodrive"

  # Parameter               configuration_file
  # Description             Path to ELMO drive configuration file. Can be
  #                         absolute (starting with "/" or "~") or relative to
  #                         this file.
  # Type                    string
  # Unit                    -
  # Range                   -
  # Default                 No file is loaded and the default configuration is
  #                         used.
  configuration_file:       "ConfigurationTemplate.yaml"

  # Parameter               interface_name
  # Description             The EtherCAT bus/interface where the ELMO drive is connected
  #                         to.
  # Type                    string
  # Unit                    -

  interface_name:           "enp0s31f6"

  # Parameter               ethercat_address
  # Description             The EtherCAT slave address of the ELMO drive.
  #                         The auto-increment method is used, so the slaves
  #                         are enumerated starting from 1, every time the bus
  #                         is started. Does not necessary have to be equal to
  #                         the slaves "index"
  # Type                    uint16
  # Unit                    -
  # Range                   {1, 2, ..., max(uint16)}
  # Default                 1
