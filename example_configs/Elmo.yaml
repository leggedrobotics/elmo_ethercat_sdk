# Explanation for some **Hardware** parameters
# ════════════════════════════════════════════

# motor_rated_current:
# ────────────────────

#   This is used as an internal scaling factor. The hardware can set the
#   target current to (signed) integer multiples of
#   motor_rated_current/1000. The current gets represented as a 16bit
#   signed integer. Setting motor_rated_current to an expected average
#   current value is good practice. This value must be greater than 0.


# gear_ratio:
# ───────────

#   Represents the gearing ratio between the motor and the joint as an
#   array of two unsigned integers:

#   [input revolutions, output revolutions].


# direction:
# ──────────

#   Either 1 or -1, for positive and negative direction respectively. The
#   ’positive’ direction is defined by the hardware configuration of the
#   Elmo (EASII gui).


# encoder_position:
# ─────────────────

#   Either ’motor’ or ’joint’.
#   • ’motor’: The encoder is assumed to be on the motor side of the
#     gearing. This means that ’position_encoder_resolution’ is assumed to
#     be the number of ticks per MOTOR REVOLUTION. The velocity and
#     position values read from the drive will thus be divided by the gear
#     ratio, while the velocity commands will by multiplied by the gear
#     ratio (where gear ratio = input_revolutions / output_revolutions).
#   • ’joint’: The encoder is assumed to be on the joint side of the
#     gearing. This means that ’position_encoder_resolution’ is assumed to
#     be the number of ticks per JOINT REVOLUTION. The velocity and
#     position values read from and commanded to the drive will thus not
#     be altered.

#   Note: All commands / readings are always in joint space (if the gear
#   ratio is set correctly). A correct configuration of the Elmo drives
#   over the EASII gui is required in order for the torque / current
#   /velocity readings and commands to have the correct magnitude and
#   sign.


# use_multiple_modes_of_operation:
# ────────────────────────────────

#   Boolean value.
#   • true: The mode of operation can be changed at any time during the
#     PDO communication by calling
#     ┌────
#     │ elmo::Command::setModeOfOperation(elmo::ModeOfOperationEnum::...)
#     └────
#     The mode of operation is initialized by the mode from the config
#     parameter ’mode_of_operation’. Whenever a command has the mode of
#     operation ’NA’ (e.g. no mode has been set explicitly) then the mode
#     is not changed, i.e. the old mode continues to be used. This
#     requires that The standard rx and tx PDO types are used.
